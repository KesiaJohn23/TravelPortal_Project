# TravelPortal_Project
For my Travel portal project, I used mixture of html, css, and javascript. I used json to fetch details of each destinations. 
The hompage.html and its styling index.css and script.js to fetch data from destination.json file and the homepage shows the preview of each destinations. In the homepage, each destinations are placed inside card and the user can view the details of each destination by clicking on view details. 
The destination.html and its styling styles.css and details.js to fetch data from destination.json. When the user click view details a new page will load that has the deatiled information about destination the user chose. It has a map of the destination and booking option to book a trip.
