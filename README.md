# TravelPortal_Project
For my Travel portal project, I used mixture of html, css, and javascript. I used json to fetch details of each destinations. 
The hompage.html and its styling index.css and script.js to fetch data from destination.json file and the homepage shows the preview of each destinations. In the homepage, each destinations are placed inside card and the user can view the details of each destination by clicking on view details. 
The destination.html and its styling styles.css and details.js to fetch data from destination.json. When the user click view details a new page will load that has the deatiled information about destination the user chose. It has a map of the destination and booking option to book a trip. 
Map Integration: I used leaflet to display the map. By using the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each destinations and set the zoom level up to 10. I used leaflet because it is simple and easier to integrate into webpage and does not require complex setups like API keys. 
Image Oraganization: I used an image folder to store all the images
